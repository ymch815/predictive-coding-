These are the codes for generating figure 7-10, S1-S5

1. Unzip the package and set the whole folder as a working path. 
2. For the following figures, you can generate them directly: Fig 7A/B, Fig 8B/C/F/G/H, Fig 9A/B, Fig 10C, Fig S1/2/3/5. 
3. For the following figures, you can either load prepared data or recalculate the data by uncommenting the codes. However, simulation process in these files may take some time: Fig 7C/D/E, Fig 8D/E, Fig 9C/D/E, Fig 10A/B, Fig S4.
